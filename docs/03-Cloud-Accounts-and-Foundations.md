After installing the tools on your workstation, follow these steps to configure them for use in your cloud control plane.

- HashiCorp Vault configuration ‚Üí [docs/runbooks/vault_bootstrap_runbook.md](runbooks/vault_bootstrap_runbook.md)  
- Terraform backend setup  
- Consul cluster setup  
- etc.

## üåê Cloud Accounts

Before continuing, ensure you have the following accounts created:

- [GitHub](https://github.com) (for source control & CI/CD)  
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) (for DNS & security)  
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) (for container images)  
- [HashiCorp Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com) (for Vault/Consul/Terraform Cloud if desired)

### ![HashiCorp Logo](https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/hashicorp.png) HashiCorp CLI Tools

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint

Verify that all tools are installed and authenticated correctly by running:

```bash
gh --version
gh auth status

wrangler --version
wrangler whoami

docker --version
docker info

terraform version
vault status
consul version
```

Make sure each command returns the expected version or status without errors before proceeding.
