# Root Access: IaC Homelab from Scratch

> **DAT** ‚Äî Define Acronyms & Terms. See the [Glossary](glossary.md) for full definitions.
> Acronyms like IaC, CI/CD, PBS, and others will show hover definitions automatically.

Welcome to the **Ops Manual** ‚Äî your field guide for hacking together a homelab from the ground up.
Embark on a journey through levels, starting from your trusty laptop and evolving into a fully automated on-premises fortress.
Each step is a quest to build, configure, and conquer your infrastructure with IaC.

## üíª What We Mean by "Workstation"

In this quest, your *workstation* is the rig you‚Äôll wield to initiate your homelab exploits.
It could be a **desktop, laptop, or PC** ‚Äî whatever hardware you have in your digital arsenal.
No need for a supercomputer; we start with what you‚Äôve got and level up from there.
