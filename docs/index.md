## 🖥️ What We Mean by "Workstation"

In this quest, your *workstation* is the rig you’ll wield to initiate your homelab exploits.
It could be a **desktop, laptop, or PC** — whatever hardware you have in your digital arsenal.
No need for a supercomputer; we start with what you’ve got and level up from there.
