# Root Access: IaC Homelab from Scratch

> **DAT:** *Define Acronyms and Terms ‚Äî your hacker‚Äôs codex for jargon, slang, and domain-specific language.*  
> Consult the [Glossary](glossary.md) for all the encrypted definitions and first-use expansions.

Welcome to the **Ops Manual** ‚Äî your field guide for hacking together a homelab from the ground up.  
Embark on a journey through levels, starting from your trusty laptop and evolving into a fully automated on-premises fortress.  
Each step is a quest to build, configure, and conquer your infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## üíª What We Mean by "Workstation"

In this quest, your *workstation* is the rig you‚Äôll wield to initiate your homelab exploits.  
It could be a **desktop, laptop, or PC** ‚Äî whatever hardware you have in your digital arsenal.  
No need for a supercomputer; we start with what you‚Äôve got and level up from there.
