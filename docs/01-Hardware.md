- Public domain names require valid SSL certificates (e.g., via Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare DNS-01).
- Private domains often use self-signed certificates or internal certificate authorities (CAs), requiring client configuration.
- Choose domain types based on access scope and security needs.
- SSL/TLS certificates should be automated where possible using ACME clients.

### Validation

- [ ] I understand the difference between public and private domain names.
- [ ] I have planned for SSL certificate acquisition or management.
- [ ] I know how to configure certificates for secure connections.

## Lab 6: Public IP and Dynamic DNS

### Description

Remote access to your homelab requires a static public IP or dynamic DNS service. This lab covers verifying your public IP and assessing internet speed.

### Verification Commands

```sh
curl -s ifconfig.me
curl -s https://ipinfo.io
```

### Speed Test Options

```sh
speedtest-cli
# or
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py | python -
```

### Additional Notes

- ISPs often provide asymmetric connections; upload speed is critical for hosting.
- Dynamic DNS services like DuckDNS, No-IP, or Cloudflare map changing IPs to fixed domain names.
- Consider IPv6 support for future-proofing and broader compatibility.
- For homelabs behind CGNAT, a VPN or tunneling service may be required for external access.

### Validation

- [ ] I have verified my public IP address or set up dynamic DNS.
