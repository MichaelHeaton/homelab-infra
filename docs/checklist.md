# 📋 Homelab Docs Alignment Checklist

!!! info "Quick Overview"
    **What:** Track style and alignment across all chapters.
    **Why:** Ensures consistency, fun, and ADHD-friendly readability.
    **Time:** Ongoing; review after editing each doc.
    **XP:** +10 per aligned chapter (like Whose Line, the points are made up but the fun is real).

## Alignment Rules
- Quick Overview block at the top with What, Why, Time, XP.
- Entry Checks before Outcomes.
- Outcomes before story intro.
- Story intro included.
- Labs hierarchically numbered (e.g., 4.1, 4.2).
- Validation under each lab with checklists and 🏆 achievements.
- Chapter Complete XP callout at the bottom (Whose Line style).
- Acronyms expanded on first use only.
- Inline nav removed, footer nav only.
