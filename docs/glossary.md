# Glossary (DAT — Define Acronyms & Terms)

!!! info "Quick Overview"
    **What:** Central glossary of acronyms and terms used across the homelab campaign.
    **Why:** Quick reference makes the journey smoother.
    **Time:** Ongoing; add terms as you go.
    **XP:** Infinite points (like Whose Line, the points are made up but the fun is real).

Think of this as your hacker’s codex: a living dictionary for all the jargon, acronyms, and tools you’ll encounter in this campaign.

## Hover definitions

Hover tooltips are defined centrally in `docs/includes/abbreviations.md` and injected on every page via `hooks.py`.
When you add a new acronym:
1. Add it here under **Terms**.
2. Add the same definition to `docs/includes/abbreviations.md` so hovers work site‑wide.

This page holds durable context for collaborating with AI on this repo. Entries are **appended** and never auto-deleted.

## Contributing Glossary Terms

Adding a term = +5 XP (don’t worry, points don’t matter—but your future self will thank you).

When adding a new acronym or term:

1. Add it to the **Terms** list for readers to browse.
2. Add it to the **Abbreviations** list so the term will display a hover definition throughout the docs.
3. Keep the definition text exactly the same in both sections to ensure consistency.
