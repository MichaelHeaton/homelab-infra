# Contributing to Homelab Infra Documentation

Welcome to the Homelab Infra documentation project! Weâ€™re excited to have you help us build a clear, engaging, and technically sound guide for homelab enthusiasts.

## Style Guide and Writing Principles

### Theme and Voice

- **Friendly and approachable:** Write as if guiding a fellow sysadmin adventurer on a quest.
- **Clear and concise:** Avoid unnecessary jargon; explain terms when first introduced.
- **Encouraging and empowering:** Inspire readers to experiment and learn.
- **Consistent tone:** Maintain an enthusiastic yet professional style throughout.

### Formatting

- Use Markdown for all content.
- Headings should be clear and descriptive.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for steps and enumerations.
- Emphasize important terms or concepts with **bold** or *italic* styles.
- Include emojis sparingly to enhance readability and engagement.

### DAT: Define Acronyms and Terms

- Always define acronyms and technical terms on first use.
- Use the DAT (Define Acronyms and Terms) section or inline explanations.
- Link to the [Glossary](glossary.md) for comprehensive definitions.
- This helps keep content accessible to newcomers and experts alike.

### "Do You Want To Know More?" Rule

- At the end of chapters or major sections, include a **Do You Want To Know More?** section.
- Provide links to related resources, deeper dives, or advanced topics.
- Include related certifications and training resources for readers who may not know what to look for.
- This encourages continuous learning without overwhelming the main narrative.

### Technical Grounding

- Ensure all instructions and explanations are accurate and verifiable.
- Test commands, configurations, and code snippets before inclusion.
- Cite sources or references when applicable.
- Keep the content up to date with the latest best practices and tools.
- Link product setup to vendor how-to and training documentation when possible, so the guide stays current with new versions.

### Page Structure

- Start with a clear introduction outlining the purpose of the page.
- Break content into logical sections with descriptive headings.
- Use examples and analogies to clarify complex concepts.
- Summarize key takeaways or next steps at the end.
- Maintain consistent navigation cues, such as links to related chapters or resources.

### File Naming Conventions

- Use `-` (dash) not `_` (underscore).
- Keep names lowercase.
- Make filenames descriptive but concise.
- Align naming with levels/chapters (e.g., `workstation-setup.md`, `phase1-foundations.md`).
