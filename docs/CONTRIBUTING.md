# Contributing to Homelab Infra Documentation

Contributing here is like joining the party. These rules keep our quest log consistent, fun, and easy to follow.

Welcome to the Homelab Infra documentation project! We’re excited to have you help us build a clear, engaging, and technically sound guide for homelab enthusiasts.

## Style Guide and Writing Principles

### Canonical Section Order
- `Entry Checks → Outcomes → Story Intro → Labs → Validation → Exit Criteria`
- `Each section should open with a 1–3 line story intro to frame the purpose`
- `Labs should use hierarchical numbering (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 3.3). Do not renumber earlier labs when adding new ones.`
- `Footer nav only. Do not add inline “## Next/Previous” sections.`

### Theme and Voice

- **Friendly and approachable:** Write as if guiding a fellow sysadmin adventurer on a quest, not a corporate manual.
- **Clear and concise:** Avoid unnecessary jargon; explain terms when first introduced.
- **Encouraging and empowering:** Inspire readers to experiment and learn.
- **Consistent tone:** Maintain an enthusiastic yet professional style throughout.

### Formatting

- Use Markdown for all content.
- Headings should be clear and descriptive.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for steps and enumerations.
- Emphasize important terms or concepts with **bold** or *italic* styles.
- Include emojis sparingly to enhance readability and engagement.
- Use front-matter `icon:` for page-level theming.

### DAT: Define Acronyms and Terms

- Always define acronyms and technical terms on first use.
- Use the DAT (Define Acronyms and Terms) section or inline explanations.
- Link to the [Glossary](glossary.md) for comprehensive definitions.
- Always add new acronyms to [Glossary](glossary.md) under **Terms**.
- Keep the Glossary in strict alphabetical order for consistency.
- Expand acronyms only on first use in each doc, then rely on Glossary and Abbreviations for consistency.

### "Do You Want To Know More?" Rule

- At the end of chapters or major sections, include a **Do You Want To Know More?** section.
- Provide links to related resources, deeper dives, or advanced topics.
- Include related certifications and training resources for readers who may not know what to look for.
- This encourages continuous learning without overwhelming the main narrative.

### Technical Grounding

- Ensure all instructions and explanations are accurate and verifiable.
- Test commands, configurations, and code snippets before inclusion.
- Cite sources or references when applicable.
- Keep the content up to date with the latest best practices and tools.
- Link product setup to vendor how-to and training documentation when possible, so the guide stays current with new versions.

### Page Structure

- Start with ## Entry Checks and ## Outcomes before any narrative.
- Follow with a short story-style introduction that frames the chapter in the journey.
- Organize Labs into subsections with hierarchical numbering (e.g., 4.1, 4.2).
- Include Validation and Exit Criteria checklists.
- Do not include inline navigation; rely on footer nav.

### File Naming Conventions

- Use `-` (dash) not `_` (underscore).
- Keep names lowercase.
- Make filenames descriptive but concise.
- Align naming with levels/chapters (e.g., `workstation-setup.md`, `phase1-foundations.md`).

Thank you for contributing to making this homelab documentation a valuable resource for everyone!

## Navigation Policy
- Footer navigation is the source of truth for Previous/Next.
- Inline navigation blocks should be removed from all pages.
